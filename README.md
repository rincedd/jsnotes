Just a few notes on the basics of JavaScript.

To get things running:
1. make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine
2. run `npm install`
3. run `grunt doc`
4. run `node app.js`
5. open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000

If you get an error message in step 3, make sure you have `grunt-cli` installed
globally by running `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
